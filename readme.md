# GT CS Junior Design Group 1332 Project - Distal Radius Implant Identifer

## Premise and Motivation

This product aims to provide a quick and easy way for surgeons to identify the manufacturer and model of the implant a patient has to have to better prepare them for the surgery ahead.
The reason we cannot use an “off-the-shelf” product for this is that no current software item is capable of identifying the specific plates and screws involved in a distal radius implant. 
Our product will be targeted directly at distal radius implants, allowing the model to be specialized incredibly tightly. This will make our model much more accurate in training and predictions. In addition, this will be built using computer vision, mobile application, and machine learning technologies allowing for a long lifespan and continuous support and maintenance for many years, even once the project leaves our group’s hands.
